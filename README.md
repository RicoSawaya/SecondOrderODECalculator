# SecondOrderODECalculator
A GUI that solves Second-Order ODEs for you and also plots the function.

This program uses the Sympy library to solve all the variables for the ODE provided
It uses Tkinter for the Graphical User Interface.
It uses MatPlotLib to graph the answer as well.

If the program is in "RLC mode", you input the Resistance, Inductance, and Capacitance. Once you input all the necessary numbers, you are given the current as a function I(x).

I learned all this information in my Electrical Engineering class and decided to make it into a program for anyone to use. 
I know for a fact that I was confused when I first started learning about this stuff so I hope anyone using this code can find it useful for them as well.
